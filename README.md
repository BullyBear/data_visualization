Data Visualization: Surviving The Titanic!

By William Stevens


Summary:

This project charts the survivability rates of 891 passengers aboard the RMS Titanic during its infamous collision with an iceberg on the night of April 15th, 1912. My hypothesis (which was shamefully influenced by the 1997 James Cameron Blockbuster hit) was that both class and gender had a tremendous impact on your chance of survival once the ship began to submerge. The accompanying data visualization demonstrates my assumption. 


Design:

I downloaded the 'Machine Learning from Disaster' dataset from Kaggle because it had already been wrangled and parsed, thus saving me a whole lot of time on the munging end of things. Moreover, I personally had already worked on this dataset for another project, so I already knew the math behind the variables (with a little help from Excel, of course). My objective here was thus to bring those calculations to life using Javascript's Dimple library (which is built on top of D3). My final chart, which can be seen in 'img 3' in the data_visualization zip, is a visual representation of my original hypothesis. Transitioning from a bubble graph to a bar graph, including a legend to explain the variables and incorporating a title to better caption my image were all changes I made because of the feedback I recieved from three different observers. 'main0.5.js' was the javascript file that included my code that produced 'img 1' before the critique. 'main.js' became the modified javascript code that produced 'img 3' once I finally incorporated the feedback into my eventual presentation. 


Feedback:

Person #1: "The bubbles are hard to read on the Y Axis - isn't there a better way to show this data off?"

Person #2: "What do the red and blue colors mean? Do I assume blue refers to men and red to women because of the horribly outdated and preconceived gender roles?"

Person #3: "I don't understand what this chart shows. Who is surviving what exactly?"
